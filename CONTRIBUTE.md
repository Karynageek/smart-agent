# Contributing and Future Interoperability of Agents

**For contributors looking to build a local agent** please wait until a test agent being built by Dan Y. (mentioned in [AGENTABILITIES](./AGENTABILITIES.md)) concludes an integration with the new agent router in [Agent Router PR](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/moragents/pull/45).
Around September 2024 the release of v0.1.0 will incorporate the above.
Release v0.1.0 will include new guides to easily and independently integrate your own local agent.

Beyond September, the router will expand to coordinate the decentralized agents along with local agents to provide for dynamic workflow construction to satisfy more complex user queries.
