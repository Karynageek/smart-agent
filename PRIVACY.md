# Privacy Policy

This application is committed to protecting the privacy and security of our users. This Privacy Policy outlines how this application collects, uses, and safeguards the information you provide when using our codebase to build applications.

## Information Collection

1. Local Execution: All execution of the applications built using this codebase is performed locally on your device. This application does not collect, store, or process any data related to the local execution of your applications.

2. External Requests: When using this codebase, your application may make requests to external services such as CoinGecko or other oracles to retrieve necessary data. These requests are made directly from your device to the respective services, and this application does not have access to or store any data related to these requests.

3. Locally Hosted LLM: The applications built using this codebase utilize a language model (LLM) that is hosted locally on your device. This application does not have access to or collect any data processed by the locally hosted LLM.

## Data Sharing

This application does not share any data collected or processed by the applications built using this codebase with third parties. As mentioned above, the only data shared are the requests made directly from your device to external services such as CoinGecko or other oracles.

## Data Security

This application takes the security of your data seriously. Although this application does not collect or store any data, it encourages you to follow best practices for securing your local environment, such as keeping your device and software up to date and using strong passwords.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

This application may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.


By using this codebase to build applications, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
